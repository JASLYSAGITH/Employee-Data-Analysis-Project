This repository contains my Python project, where I analyzed a dataset provided by ABC Company. This dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns, representing employee information across various teams. 

 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the employee data of the ABC company and  provide comprehensive report on key insights about their workforce.

Important stages
- Data preprocessing : cleaning and preprocessing data set by handling missing values, correcting datatypes and ensuring data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data using statistical and graphical methods.
- Data Visualization: Creating insightful charts and graphs to convey findings effectively.
- Comprehensive Reporting: Summarizing insights on employee demographics, team distributions, performance, and other metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

Tools and Technologies

- Python: For data analysis and preprocessing.
- Pandas: For data manipulation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
- Jupitor: For running the code 

Deliverables

- Cleaned dataset.
- Interactive visualizations.
- Detailed analysis report.
